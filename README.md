# AUTOMATIC-WATER-DISPENSER
The main purpose of Automatic Water Dispenser is to perform water automation. We can 
replace the manual taps with a smart one that opens and closes on its own automatically. Not 
only we can save water but also have a better lifestyle since we don't have to operate the tap 
with our hands. With the help of Automatic Water Dispenser we can avoid wastage of water 
and reduce human effort. Glass is automatically filled with water when it's detected by the 
sensor which reduces water wastage and helps in water conservation to comply with 
environment requirement.
